# QuarantineQubit
An interactive, command line project that relates the uncertainty of 2020 to the uncertainty of Quantum computing. Created as a final project for English 384. 

# Running Program
There are two ways to run this on your computer. First is to run it from the command line, which is the intended way to interact with the project. You can also run it on an online python interpreter. I will outline both methods below 
### Mac:
1. Open terminal on your computer
2. You should be able to type `cd Desktop` and navigate to your desktop
3. Here, you will download the project. Type `git clone git@github.com:alexmcgr/QuarantineQubit.git` and you should download the repository and put it in a folder on your desktop.
4. Still on terminal, type `cd QuarantineQubit` to get into the project folder
5. Now, here you will need to see what version of python you are running. Type `python --version`
	1. If it is Python 2.x, start the program by typing `python main.py`
	2. If it is Python 3.x start the program by typing `python3 main.py`
6. Enjoy!
### Windows:
1. I unfortunately do not have a Windows machine so I am not sure of the exact steps to guide through the command 
line setup. You can surely follow the above steps for Mac but it might be a little different (Same basic process 
though, git clone into the project and then go into the folder and run the python file). Part of the fun of the 
project could be trying to run the program, especially if you havenâ€™t done anything like this in the past!
2. There is another way to do it that is all online, however! First, copy the entirety of the file called `main.py` 
from above. You can download the file if you are having trouble copying it. Then, [navigate here](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler) delete all of their placeholder code and paste all of the code from `main.py` 
you copied  into the 
main box. Make sure the 
top box says Python3 and then hit the green run button at the top and enjoy!

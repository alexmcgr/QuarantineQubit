# QuarantineQubit
An interactive, command line project that relates the uncertainty of 2020 to the uncertainty of Quantum computing. 
Created by Alex McGregor in December 2020 for English 384 at the University of Washington. 

Programmed in Python using the Pycharm IDE from Jetbrains. Special thanks to my peer review group -- Jay Kudler, Lily 
Kleven, and Fran Seong -- for providing valuable feedback on early versions of the project. 
# How to run the Program
If you have experience running python code from the command line of your computer, please interact with the project 
in that way! You can clone the repo to your machine and run `python3 main.py` in the directory `QuarantineQubit`. 

If you don't have experience with the command line, there is a very simple way to interact with and run the program as 
well! First, go to [this online python interpreter](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler). Delete the 
text on line 9 that says `print("Hello World")` and click on the Interactive Console toggle at the bottom of the 
screen if it is not already clicked. Next, copy the code on the `main.py` file from this repo, [linked here for 
convenience](https://github.com/alexmcgr/QuarantineQubit/blob/main/main.py) (You can also click on the file above 
that is called `main.py`). Make sure you copy all the 500 plus lines of code from that link. A tip on copying 
the whole file is to click the Raw button on the code page and then pressing Command + A or Control + A for Mac 
and Windows, respectively, to select everything and then copy from there. Finally, go back to the 
python interpreter and paste the code into the main window, where you deleted the `print("Hello World")` a moment ago
. Make sure that the top right corner of the site where there is a language toggle is set to `Python 3` and feel free
 to drag on the bottom divider to expand the bottom, input portion of the screen. When you are ready, click the green
  Run button in the upper left of the main window, and enjoy!
